Derek is attempting to create a program to help his family understand his irrational food preferences. 
He is using his own programming language, ZQ, which supports multiple inheritance. ZQ function dispatch 
is calculated using depth first alphabetical iteration of superclasses. 

Given this set of classes, which foods (concrete classes) does Derek like? If the function Edible::isGood
determines Derek's opinion of the food.


interface Edible {
	default fun isGood(): Boolean = true
}

abstract class Vegetable implements Edible {
 	val isHealthy: Boolean
	override fun isGood(): Boolean = isHealthy
}

abstract class Fruit implements Edible {
}

class Apple extends Fruit {
}

class Cucumber extends Fruit {
	override val isGood(): Boolean = false
}

class Smoothie extends Fruit, Vegetable {
	val isHealthy = false
}


class Broccoli extends Vegetable {
	val isHealthy = true
}

class AppleSauce extends Apple, Smoothie {
	val isHealthy = false
}

class WeirdSalad extends Cucumber, Broccoli {
}
